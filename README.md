# Random Beer Statistics

Random project I made that get's 20 random beer's from randomdata api
and displays their style in matplotlib barchart

# How to get running

- Clone the repo with `git clone`
- `cd` to directory
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run with `python main.py`

## TODO
- [x] Option to choose how many random beer's get's fetched
- [x] Option to change what get's taken to bar chart (hop, yeast, malts, etc.)
- [ ] Check that correct data type is inserted
- [ ] Other things to correct user mistakes
